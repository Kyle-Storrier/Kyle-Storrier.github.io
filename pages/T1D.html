<p>Since 2009, I have been living with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune form of diabetes which often first shows itself in normally healthy children. Only about 5-10% of people with diabetes have type 1. With a little bit of planning and perseverance, T1D can be well managed.</p>
<p>T1D is also a great teacher of patience, persistence, diligence and attention to detail.
Many people, including myself, have found diabetes to be a gift.  Not that I would wish it on anyone, but it has taught me a lot. My T1D diagnosis started me looking for new activities and challenges leading me into robotics three weeks after my diagnosis. Robotics eventually led me to the field of computer science and where I am today.
<br><br>
I have compiled a list of frequently asked questions about how I have successfully managed attending university with T1D. I hope that this is helpful information. Best wishes!</p>

           <div class="faq_answer_container">
              <div class="faq_answer"><hr><p>I always get a locker that is centrally located to my classes. I usually get a half-size locker. I bought several tubs at the dollar store. I fill one tub with diabetes supplies, and the other two I fill with snacks such as cereal bars, trail mix, fruit bars and packs of cookies. I also bought a locker shelf from an office supply store, so I have room for supplies on top and school books or a coat on the bottom.</p>

				  <p>Since I live about a 40 minute commute from school, I have a full stash of supplies in my locker. If you live closer to your school, you may not need as many supplies on hand. If you take a bit of time to plan ahead, you will have strong blood-sugar control, feel great and do your best in school.
<br>
Here is a list of the supplies I have at university:
<br>
In my locker:

<ul>
<li>2-3 spare infusion sets</li>
<li>2-3 spare pump insulin cartridges</li>
<li>Spare insulin</li>
<li>Extra batteries (tester and pump)</li>
<li>Spare test strips</li>
<li>Alcohol wipes</li>
<li>An insulin pen set for emergency use (if my infusion set fails, for example) with a small sticker with the start date. Pens should be changed out monthly.</li>
<li>Juice boxes</li>
<li>Dex Tabs</li>
<li>Medical Tape (in case I need to tape my CGM sensor or infusion down)</li>
<li>Snacks (cereal bars, fruit bars, trail mix, cookies and so on)</li>
</ul>

				  <hr>
				  <p>As a student with T1D, there are many things that you can do to ensure your exams go well. I have found the following to be very helpful strategies:</p>
				  <ul>
				  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eat a healthy snack or meal before an exam.</span> I ensure that I eat some carbohydrates for energy before a test, but not too many so my blood sugars go high. I also like to eat protein with the carbohydrate to help stabilize the carbohydrate’s effects on my blood. Chicken wraps work well for me.</li>
				  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I almost always wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM),</span> and I ensure that my CGM isn’t going to time-out during a test. I also plan to change sensors at least 1-2 days before a major exam, so they are well calibrated and accurate by the day of the test. I generally don’t check my blood during an exam as I can use my CGM to show my blood sugar levels as well as where my levels are trending. I have Dex Tabs or food, if necessary, but I generally don’t find that I need to eat during an exam often.</li>
				  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pack a baggie of supplies.</span> Bringing in a clear baggie with supplies of low treatments, a blood tester and cereal bars to an exam is also a good idea. You should show these to your exam supervisor, so they know what is in the bag.</li>
				  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consider Registering with Accessibility Services:</span> In the summer before my first year of university began, I registered with my universities Accessibility Services. I needed to provide documentation from my endocrinologist confirming my diabetes. At the start of each semester, I go to Accessibility Services and pick up a letter for each of my professors explaining my diabetes. I then speak to each professor letting them know about my diabetes and having them sign the form which allows me to take exams at the exam center. I do not do all of my exams at the exam center as some require the use of specialized software which is only on the lab computers. I like taking the tests in the test center when possible as it is easy for the staff to supervise me while I am checking my blood or eating carbs, if necessary, but I have not had problems taking exams in the classrooms or labs as well. Where I chose to write my exam depends on the particular class and professor.</li>
				  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pay attention to your health, study, prepare yourself, and you will be ready for your university exams.</span></li>
				  </ul>

              <div class="faq_answer"><hr>
              <p>My professors have always been very supportive when I have told them that I have type 1 diabetes. Here is how I approach professors whom I need to speak to about my diabetes:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I wait until the end of the first lecture when they aren’t busy.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I show them the Accessibility Form when I am looking to write the class exams in the exam center,</span> and I have them sign it.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I tell them that I have type 1 diabetes.</span> I explain to them that because of the diabetes, I have to manage my blood sugar levels manually which I can do with my CGM and Dex Tabs. I show them a new pack of Dex Tabs, so they understand that it is like medicine to me not just a mid-class snack. If eating in class isn’t an issue, I don’t bother showing the Dex Tabs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I am thankful that my professors have always been kind, supportive and allowed me to use Dex Tabs and/or eat in class.</p>

			  <hr><p>Managing your time is critical for success at school as well as in life. Here are some tips and photos to help you develop a time management system that works for you.</p>
              
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make a weekly plan before the semester begins.</span> This will give you a routine to get started at the beginning of the semester, so you don’t need to think about what to do or waste time trying to remember what you should study. Your plan is your guide.</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan study times after each class as soon as possible to review the class material.</span> Consider making a formula or condensed study sheet to help with your review times and studying for exams. As you will see shortly, I try to stick to my plan as much as possible, but there are times when I need to be more flexible. Here is a sample of one of my semesters: <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/T1D-Tips/IMG_2373.JPG" alt="Study Schedule" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 75%;"></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consider buying a large calendar where you can see your entire semester at a glance.</span> I color code each of my subjects, and I write in my assignment due dates and exams at the very beginning of each semester. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/T1D-Tips/IMG_2375.JPG" alt="Calendar Photo" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 75%;"></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I also take each of the due dates on my large calendar, and I put them into my online calendar which is part of my university account.</span> I input each of my classes and other important information into this calendar. I also make use of the reminder/alert feature.</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">When I have a lot of assignments and exams, my schedule needs to be flexible.</span> During midterms, finals and busy weeks, I use my weekly study plan as a guide, and I make a special plan for the week using a weekly planner. I try to stick to my weekly study schedule as much as possible, but it is important to be able to adapt to busy times or unusual weeks. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/T1D-Tips/IMG_2363.JPG" alt="Weekly Planner" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 75%;"></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember, it is also important to plan time to eat a proper lunch in your schedule.</span></li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Week-ends are my flex days.</span> I do not have a regular plan for my week-ends other than some relaxation and sports with friends. I use the week-ends to study for exams, finish assignments, get ahead or work on challenging course topics. I make a plan at the beginning of each week-end.</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Finally, plan for break times, fun, time with friends and recreational activities.</span> In addition to studying, relaxing and exercising, it is important to plan to take care of your diabetes. Consider reviewing your basil rates each week. Sunday evenings tend to work well for me. I also like to glance at my semester calendar and online calendar to check on important things happening during the week. This helps me decide when to change my CGM sensor and infusion sets.

</ul>

<p>If you plan ahead, diligently stick to your plan while being flexible, you will probably reduce your stress levels, be successful in school, manage your health well and have fun in the process! Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about how I manage my diabetes as a university student.</p>
