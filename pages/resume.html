<p>I am a second year computer science student taking second and third year computer science and pure math courses while auditing a fourth year course in distributed algorithms.</p>
<p>Since 2009, I have been a leader on a competitive robotics team and a controls and software mentor for the past three years. My experience programming competitive robots has given me knowledge about designing and producing software while working on a multidisciplinary team. You can find more information about this on my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">projects page.</a></p>
<p>I am looking for an opportunity where I can use and further refine my software development skills. My proven ability to persevere when solving problems, along with my passion for learning new skills, would allow me to effectively contribute as an intern on a software development team. If you think that I may be a fit for your company, contact me at <a id="e addr">[first name].[lastname] [at] gmail [dot] com</a></p>
