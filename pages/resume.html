<p id="email test"></p>
<p>I am a second year computer science student taking second and third year computer science and pure math courses and auditing a fourth year course in distributed algorithms at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>Since 2009, I have been a leader on a competitive robotics team as well as a controls and software mentor for three competitive robotics teams for the past three years. My experience programming competitive robots has given me knowledge about designing and producing software while working with a multidisciplinary team. You can find more information about this on my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">projects page.</a></p>
<p>I am looking ahead to next summer, and I would like to find a company where I can be challenged and mentored as well as contribute on a software development team. I can be contacted by email at: <a id="e addr">[first name].[lastname] [at] gmail [dot] com</a></p>
