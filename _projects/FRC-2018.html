	For the 2018 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) season, 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZbdwYiCY74">FIRST Power Up</a>, 
	I continued to mentor the SWAT Bots. The 2018 challenge required 
	robots to place cubes on balancing goals of varying heights in 
	order to score points. The SWAT Bots’ robot, Shadow, used a wheeled 
	intake to collect the cubes and to launch them into the goals. 
	Shadow’s cube intake mechanism was mounted on a two-stage cascading 
	elevator which could raise and lower the mechanism to score in the 
	vault, switch, and scale.

	Unfortunately, the height of the goals made it extremely difficult 
	for the SWAT Bots to test Shadow before the tournament. This forced 
	us to make several changes and corrections at the tournament. We 
	also didn’t have access to a large space to practice our robot 
	driving in. Despite these setbacks, the SWAT Bots made it to the 
	quarterfinals at the Canadian Rockies Regional in Calgary.
