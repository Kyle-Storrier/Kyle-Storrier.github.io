<p>
	For the 2017 FRC competition, <a href="https://youtu.be/EMiNmJW7enI">FIRST Steamworks</a>, I began mentoring the SWAT Bots.
	Our initial goal was to produce a robot capable of shooting wiffle balls, called "fuel", into a goal.
	However, launching the balls quickly and accurately turned out to be extremely challenging,
	so the team decided that the time required to get ball shooting to work well could be better spent on other components of the robot.
	This led to the decision to focus on the other two objectives in the game, delivering gears and climbing a rope.
	As a result of this choice, we were able to produce a simple and reliable robot.

	In competition, He Who Shall Not Be Named performed extremely 
	consistently in both autonomous and drive controlled modes.
	This consistent performance propelled the SWAT Bots to the position
	of tournament finalists at the Western Canada FRC regional and qualified them for the FRC world championship.
