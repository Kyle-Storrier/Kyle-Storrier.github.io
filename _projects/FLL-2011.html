<p>In my third year of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL), my team and I built on our experience from our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/FLL-2009.html">first</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/FLL-2010.html">second</a> year of FLL as we competed in the <a href="https://youtu.be/SvdTbTf4G0k">2011 - 2012 FLL challenge</a> "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Factor">Food Factor</a>." The experience my team had gained allowed us to develop several unique subsystems including line following and a dumping mechanism mechanically activated by a bumper on the front of the robot that I designed.</p>

<p>This year we again won the 1st place in robot performance and the champions award. By winning the champions we received an invitation to the FLL World Festival in St. Louis, Missouri.This was an amazing and extremely inspiring experience. I was especially inspired by being able to watch the competitions being held for the high school level competitions held by FIRST.</p>
