<p>In September 2010, I began working with my team to complete the 2010-2011 FIRST LEGO League (FLL) challenge, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Forward">Body Forward</a>. With the experience we gained through our previous season of FLL, we set off to complete the biomedical engineering themed research project and the <a href="https://youtu.be/tEwTO3S5eOs">robot challenge</a>.</p>

<p>During this season I began to become more interested in programming, particularly in the "Bad Cell Destruction" mission which is still one of my overall favorite challenges from FLL.</p>
<p>At our competition, we had amazing success, and we won First Place in Robot Performance and the Tournament Champions Award, the highest award in FLL. This season was an amazing experience for me and served to deeply inspire me to continue in engineering and computer science.</p>
