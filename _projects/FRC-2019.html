	I returned to mentor the software and control system team of the 
	SWAT Bots for the 2019 FRC season, 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/Mew6G_og-PI">Destination Deep Space</a>. 
	This season, we had many new students join our team which increased 
	the total number of SWAT Bots students to 25. We decided to focus 
	on having a solid robot which consistently completed the climbing 
	objective and could score at the low goals on the field. We also 
	decided not to focus on scoring in the high goals in order to make 
	our robot less complex and to give our team more time to fine tune 
	and practice with our robot. Once completed, our robot could climb 
	to any level of the platform, and it could score cargo and hatches 
	on the low goals.

 The resulting robot, which we named Wart Hog, succeeded beyond our 
 wildest dreams. At the Canadian Rockies Regional, the SWAT Bots ranked 
 fifth out of 37 teams and made it to the tournament finals round. As 
 the tournament finalists, we received an invitation to the FRC world 
 championship in Houston, Texas where we competed on the Newton 
 division. At the end of the qualification rounds for our division, the 
 SWAT Bots ranked ninth out of the 67 teams from all over the world who 
 made up the Newton division. The SWAT Bots became the alliance captain 
 of alliance seven, and our alliance was able to make it to the division 
 finals where we were defeated by the alliance which would go on to win 
 the entire world championship. I am extremely excited about our success 
 this season, and I am glad to have been able to contribute to this 
 amazing season.
