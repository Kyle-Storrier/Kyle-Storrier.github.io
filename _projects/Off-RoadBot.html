<p>The summer after I completed my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/FLL-2011.html">third and final season in FLL</a>, I got the amazing opportunity to be on a team building a robot for an off-road bot challenge. The team was sponsored by <a href="https://www.ez-robot.com/">EZ-Robot</a> and mentored by EZ-Robot CEO, <a href="https://www.ez-robot.com/About/Get-To-Know-Us.aspx?id=3">DJ Sures</a>.</p>
<p>The robot was based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_scooter">motorized mobility scooter</a>. We then removed the outer covering and the controlling electronics. The team installed new heavy duty motor controllers and one of EZ-Robots robot controllers. We also added some sensors to aid the robot's navigation. Finally, the repainted outer shell for the scooter was placed on the robot to cover up the electronics. The robot was very robust as is shown by the fact that <a href="https://www.ez-robot.com/Community/Forum/Thread?threadId=2233">DJ used it to shovel his snow</a> the following winter.</p>

<p>Overall, this opportunity allowed me to expand my robotics knowledge to include some electronics I had never had an opportunity to use before, and, as such, was a success for me. It was a very fun challenge to re-purpose the old scooter into a robot.</p>
