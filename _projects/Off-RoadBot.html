The team was sponsored by <a href="https://www.ez-robot.com/">EZ-Robot</a> and mentored by EZ-Robot CEO, <a href="https://www.ez-robot.com/About/Get-To-Know-Us.aspx?id=3">DJ Sures</a>.</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The robot was based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_scooter">motorized mobility scooter</a>. We then removed the outer covering and the controlling electronics. The team installed new heavy duty motor controllers and one of EZ-Robots robot controllers. We also added some sensors to aid the robot's navigation. Finally, the repainted outer shell for the scooter was placed on the robot to&nbsp;cover up&nbsp;the electronics. The robot was very robust as is shown by the fact that <a href="https://www.ez-robot.com/Community/Forum/Thread?threadId=2233">DJ used it to shovel his snow</a> the following winter.</span>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Overall, this opportunity allowed me to expand my robotics knowledge to include some electronics I had never had an opportunity to use before, and, as such, was a success for me. It was a very fun challenge to&nbsp;re-purpose&nbsp;the old&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">scooter into a robot.</span>
