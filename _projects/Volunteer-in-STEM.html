<p>Over the last several years, I have had many opportunities to volunteer in various capacities at children's science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) events, day camps, workshops, and competitions. During this time, I have discovered numerous benefits of volunteering in children's STEM programs. Here are my top four reasons:</p>

During that time, I was able to help several young, talented programmers to continue developing their skills.  In return, they have further ignited my passion for science, technology engineering, and math.</p></li>

These skills proved extremely valuable for me when I was my high school graduation valedictorian.  I know that my experiences volunteering and teaching at FIRST events will be a huge benefit for my future, and I hope that I have inspired others in the process as well.</p></li>

	<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">It gives you an opportunity to help build a community.</span> I have been able to assist in building community by volunteering at a number of FLL events which helped FLL expand in Alberta. Additionally, I helped the SWAT Bots put on a series of Monthly Robotics Challenges which allowed us to spread our love of robotics to our community.</p></li>
