title: Recon (FRC 2015)
order: 7
about: Recon was a robot that my team, the SWAT Bots, created to compete in the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition, "Recycle Rush." With Recon the SWAT Bots became tournament finalists at the Western Canada Regional.

<p>After our successful <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/FRC-2014">2014 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) season</a>, I, and the other SWAT Bots, felt ready to push forward for more competition and an even bigger challenge in the 2015 season. We got the challenge we were looking for when FIRST released "<a href="https://youtu.be/W6UYFKNGHJ8">Recycle Rush</a>."</p>

<p>In addition to the robot challenge, my team wanted to be a contender for the Chairman's Award, an award which celebrates teams which embody and spread the goals of FIRST. The Chairman's Award is the highest award an FRC team can win at an FRC tournament. The application for the Chairman's Award requires a team to produce an essay, a video, and a presentation at the competition where the team is applying for the Chairman's Award. All of these requirements are designed by teams to highlight the reason their team is the most complete example of the ideals of FIRST.</p>
<p>For the robot competition, we decided that the top priority for the team was to produce a robot which could effectively stack totes obtained from the human player station. We also decided that a lower priority was to design the robot so it could handle recycling containers and perform basic autonomous functions. The list of priorities that we produced became a fundamental element in the design of our robot.</p>

<p>Our priorities directed the design and building of our robot which we named "Recon." Recon featured an integrated ramp which allowed us to simply back Recon up against the human player station and then the human player could begin quickly loading totes into Recon. Recon was designed so that it could stack the totes it received into stacks up to five totes tall. Later, once all our high priority features were added, we enhanced Recon so that it could handle recycling bins as well as totes. Recon could produce a stack of four totes with one recycling bin on top. At the same time I added several autonomous modes to Recon, enabling us to gain points in the autonomous period of the game. These autonomous programs are <a href="https://github.com/SWATBots/RecycleRush">freely available on GitHub</a> along with the rest of the code developed for Recon.</p>

<p>At the Western Canada Regional competition, we had immense success with Recon. We had an average qualification match score of 67 points which made us the 6th seeded team at the end of qualification matches. Our team was invited, and accepted, an invitation to join the 2nd seeded team, team 2013, the Cybergnomes. We then added team 3513, Misfit Toys, to our alliance. Then our alliance played through the quarterfinals where we were second highest ranked with an average score of 99.5 points per match. Our average score made us one of the four alliances to advance to semifinals. In semifinals we were able to average 117.33 points per match making us one of the two teams to advance to the finals. Once we reached the finals we had to face the number one seeded alliance of teams 4719, 2130, and 5118. The first two matches were close with the number one alliance winning the first match with 135 points to our 102 points. The second match was even tighter as we won the second match with 135 points to the number one seeded alliance's 118. Unfortunately for our alliance, in our third and final match team 2013's robot tipped over twice, and, despite our alliance's best efforts, we were unable to match the points the number one seed produced with there three robots working at full capacity. This resulted in us losing our last match by a score of 135 to 81. We had an amazing time and greatly enjoyed working with the members of our alliance.</p>

<p>Despite our loss in the competition, we managed to impress the judges with our Chairman's Award presentation and our judging results. Because of this success, we were honored to be selected as the Chairman's Award winner for the Western Canada Regional. Winning this award also won us an invitation to the FRC World Championship in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

<p>In St. Louis we were able to meet and even compete with some of the top FRC teams in the world. This served as an amazing learning experience for many of us. However, being at the World Championship brought us face-to-face with the weaknesses of our robot. For example, at the World Championship teams often possessed robots capable of stacking six totes with a bin on top with relative ease and stability. Our robot lacked this ability and was limited to lifting four totes with one bin on top and dropping entire stacks at times. Another weakness our robot faced was the fact that our robot was incapable of performing can burgling, a term used to refer to robots grabbing recycling bins off the center dividing area of the field. At the Western Canada Regional can burgling was of limited value because alliances rarely needed to use the recycling bins mounted on the center divider, which was officially named the "step." However, at the World Championship, can burgling had become critical with matches often being decided by the ability of teams to remove the recycling bins from the step within the first split-seconds of the match's opening autonomous period. We learned from these weaknesses for the future. Despite these weaknesses, we ranked 37 in our Championship division with a qualification average of 124.1 points. Overall, our trip to the World Championship was an amazing experience, and I personally greatly enjoyed it and learned immensely from it.</p>
