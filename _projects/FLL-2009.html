<p>One of the first events that directed my interests towards engineering and computer science was my involvement in <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST LEGO League (FLL)</a>. FLL is a challenge where teams of students from ages 9 to 14 must build a robot with LEGO Mindstorms kits to complete a game challenge. The students also complete a research project and create a solution to a real-world problem based on the yearly theme which they present to professionals in the field who judge the innovation and quality of the research. The robot challenge and the theme are released every year in September by the organization <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/">For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST)</a>.</p>

<p>I joined FLL for the 2009 - 2010 season, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Move_(FIRST)">Smart Move</a>, where the theme of the challenge was transportation. The robot challenge is summarized in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=747dTPhSaQs">this video</a>. My team had an amazing time at the competition, and we were honored to receive third place for robot design. Winning the award and the experience of the competition solidified my involvement in FIRST that continues to this day.</p>
