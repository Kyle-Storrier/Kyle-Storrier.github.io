<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Going into the 2016 FRC season, the SWAT Bots faced our first major&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;of student turnover which left me as one of only three FRC veterans on the team. Additionally, this season, I was honored to become the student captain of the team. Despite the difficulty we faced from training our new, smaller, and less experienced team, we were ready for whatever the 2016 FRC season had in store for us. So we were ready when FIRST released the 2016 challenge, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOKzoHJDjA">FIRST Stronghold</a>."</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The SWAT Bots considered a wide variety of strategies as we developed our 2016 robot. Eventually we decided to use a two-wheeled shooter mechanism to score boulders, 10 inch diameter dodgeballs, into the low goal and potentially the high goal. After several iterations of development, we produced "Parthannax." Parthannax was dominated by three main subsystems, &nbsp;the drive system, the shooter, and the intake.</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The drive system was a standard FRC kitbot which had been enhanced with a pneumatic tire add-on kit. We also cut the front of the kitbot so that it had an angled front to make it easier to drive over the many obstacles on the field.</span>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/FRC-2016/image2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Displaying DSC02225.JPG" aria-hidden="true" border="0" class="aLF-aPX-J1-J3 aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR" height="150" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/FRC-2016/image2.jpg" width="200" /></a><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The intake system used a top row of wheels to suck the boulder into the shooter where it was pulled in by the three wheels within the shooter. In the end, we greatly enhanced our intake mechanism later in the season by adding a powered wheel to each side of the intake mechanism to pull and guide balls into the main intake bar and the shooter. The entire intake was raised and lowered by two pneumatic cylinders. Additionally, the intake mechanism was initially planned to feature a mechanism to handle the&nbsp;Cheval de Frise obstacle. However, the&nbsp;Cheval de Frise mechanism we developed could not fit into the robot perimeter and was not allowed for competition.</span>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/FRC-2016/image3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Displaying webrobots2-kenneth-appleby.jpg.size.xxlarge.promo.jpg" aria-hidden="true" border="0" class="aLF-aPX-J1-J3 aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR" height="212" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/FRC-2016/image3.jpg" width="320" /></a><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The shooter used two 775pro motors from VEX Robotics to power its two shooter wheels. A third wheel connected to a VEX Robotics BAG motor held the boulder in place until the shooter wheels &nbsp;reached the desired velocity. Once the shooting wheels were moving fast enough, the driver responsible for the intake and shooter activated the BAG motor holding the boulder in place so that the boulder was quickly pushed into the shooter wheels. The entire shooter mechanism could be raised to shoot at the high goal or lowered to pickup balls or shoot in the low goal. The shooter was raised and lowered by a pneumatic cylinder placed underneath the shelf which held the robot's electronics. The shooter was setup so that it could hit the high goal when the robot was near the base of the tower. Parthannax's shooter also featured a network camera mounted on top of the shooter. The images from the network camera were streamed to the driver station computer where the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.roborealm.com/FRC2016/index.php">Roborealm</a>&nbsp;computer vision software was used to overlay lines onto the portion of the image where the boulder should hit when it was launched from the robot. The drivers used these lines like the scope on a gun to ensure that Parthannax was extremely accurate.</span>

</span> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/FRC-2016/image4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Displaying DSC02159.JPG" aria-hidden="true" border="0" class="aLF-aPX-J1-J3 aLF-aPX-aLK-ayr-auR" height="320" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/FRC-2016/image4.jpg" width="239" /></a><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Overall, building Parthannax was one of the biggest challenges I, or anyone else on the team, had ever faced. This mainly stemmed from the complexity of Parthannax, which was remembered very well by the judges for possessing ten motors. &nbsp;Parthannax was exceptionally robust and only required a few minor repairs at the competition. It was also a challenge for me because, in addition to my previous roles as team leader and lead programmer, I was also the only person on the electrical, programming, and controls team. On top of that Parthannax's software, which is now&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SWATBots/SWAT-Bots-FRC-2016">freely available on GitHub</a>, was some of the most complex I have had to develop for FRC robots.</span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The Western Canada Regional was a thrilling experience for me, in part, because I was chosen by my team to be our team representative in alliance selection and to be one of our two drivers. Unfortunately, we faced many difficult matches as we tweaked slight flaws in our competition bot and adjusted the robot for the real field. Additionally, the harsh nature of the game and the system used to assign teams for qualification matches left us playing several matches with alliance partners who were either broken or not present. In the end, the SWAT Bots ranked 23rd in the competition and were picked for the 5th seeded alliance with teams&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4634/2016">4634, the Wolfbotz</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/216/2016">216, More RoboDawgs</a>. Our alliance played hard and was able to eliminate the 4th seeded alliance in quarterfinals. However, in the semifinals we had to face the number one seeded alliance, and, despite a firm competition from every member of our alliance, we were eliminated. The first seeded alliance went on to win the finals without a single loss in the elimination matches. Despite being eliminated, we still were able to win the Quality award sponsored by the Motorola Solutions Foundation, and we received a peer award from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4613">team 4613, the Barker Redbacks</a>&nbsp;which celebrated our robot's "Aesthetic Design."</span>

</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">While the 2016 season may have been one of the hardest challenges I have ever faced, I can safely say that it was also one of the greatest opportunities that I have ever had. I expanded my leadership skills and my technical skills immensely over the course of the season, and in the end, I, along with the other members of the SWAT Bot's team, produced Parthannax, a quality robot which we can truly be proud of.</span>
