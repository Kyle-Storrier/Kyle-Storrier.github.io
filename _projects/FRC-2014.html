<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">After finishing my first year in FTC, I planned on continuing to compete in FTC. However, around that same time the <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</a>, a competition where students grades nine to twelve build robots weighing approximately 120 pounds, began to really gain traction in the area where my team was based. This explosive growth in FRC caused my team to transition from FTC to FRC where we became FRC team #5015 SWAT Bots Robotics.</span>

</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Unlike FTC and FLL, the yearly challenge for FRC is released in January and teams only have six weeks to build a robot. In 2014 FRC teams faced a challenge called "<a href="https://youtu.be/oxp4dkMQ1Vo">Aerial Assist</a>." We quickly produced a prototype of a linear punch style shooter. We then mounted the shooter and the electronics on the FRC kitbot chassis. The punch was drawn back by a <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/motion/gearboxes/ball-shifter.html">VEXPro Ball Shifter</a> powered by two <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/motors-electronics/217-2000.html">CIM motors</a>. The robot featured a simple autonomous program that drove forward to gain five points.</span>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">After the completion of the six week build season, we had to seal our robot into a large plastic bag and wait until our first and only competition, the Western Canada Regional held at the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Alberta. We were honored to receive the Rookie All-Star award at the regional. We also ranked 5th in the competition with a record of nine wins and six losses. We became the captain of the fourth alliance, and we were ultimately eliminated in the quarterfinals. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our first season in FRC although we would have definitely changed several aspects of our robot.</span>

</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The main problem we faced with our robot was the fact that the motors and gearbox that powered the shooter made the shooter unbalanced and difficult to control. This problem was amplified by the fact that the balance of the shooter changed when the robot picked up the ball.The motors also had difficulty pulling back and holding back the elastic powered punch. This resulted in problems including smoke pouring out of the motors and gearbox used in the punch.</span>

</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I was extremely pleased with my team's performance in our first year of FRC, and I greatly expanded my knowledge and abilities over the course of the season.</span>
