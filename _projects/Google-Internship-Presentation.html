	During my Summer 2019 internship at Google, I took part in the Intern 
	Talks program at the Google office in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, 
	Canada. This gave me the opportunity to give a ten to fifteen minute 
	presentation, on a topic of my choice, to Google engineers and interns. 
	I entitled the presentation “Treasures in Retrogame Archeology”, and I 
	chose to present about some of the lessons that I had learned studying 
	retro videogames in the <a href="https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/retro-info.html">retrogames</a>
	special topic class offered by the University of Calgary.
