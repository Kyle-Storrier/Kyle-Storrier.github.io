<p>In September 2012, I tried something new. The <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)</a> is a competition for students grades 7 to 12. Along with four other students, three of which had been with me in the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) the previous year, we formed FTC team #5955 SWAT Bots Robotics. In September, FIRST released released the 2012 - 2013 FTC challenge "<a href="https://youtu.be/oIQtLqLT654">Ring it Up!</a>"</p>

<p>Once the challenge was released, we got to work, and we produced our robot "Chuck." Chuck used a variant on the slide drive for his drive-train. This special drive system enabled Chuck to strafe sideways while also being able to turn and drive forward and backward like a standard tank drive robot. Chuck also had an unfolding ramp mounted on top of him. The ramp was held in place by string wrapped around a LEGO NXT motor. When it was time for the ramp to be released for another robot to climb on top of Chuck, the motor was used to unwind the string holding the ramp in place. Chuck used a hand made out of LEGO pieces to manipulate the game pieces. The hand was mounted on to a double-jointed arm which was mounted on top of a multi staged cascading forklift mechanism.</p>

<p>As the only programmer on the team I was responsible for creating Chuck's teleop and autonomous modes. Some of the autonomous modes were simple autonomous programs where Chuck drove forward and hung a ring on the peg directly in front of him. However, Chuck also had advanced autonomous modes where he strafed sideways looking for an IR beacon and then hung the ring on that column. In these advanced programs, Chuck would also move forward or backward to compensate for the sideways wheels used for strafing which occasionally lost traction when they came to dips in the foam tiles on the field. Additionally, Chuck's lift was controlled by two mechanically independent motors which were synchronized using a proportional control loop.</p>

<p>When we brought Chuck to competition at the Canadian FTC Championship, we won the competition in an alliance with FTC team #5009 and the Rockwell Collins Innovate Award. We won the Inspire Award which was the highest award given out at the FTC tournament. After our success at the Canadian Championship, we were invited to the FTC World Championship in St. Louis, Missouri. The trip to the world championship was an extremely inspiring and enjoyable experience, and, to this day, it is one of the best experiences I had while in any of the FIRST competitions. I even had the opportunity to meet Dean Kamen, inventor and founder of FIRST.</p>
