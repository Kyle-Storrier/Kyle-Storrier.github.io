	<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Asphalt `80</h2>
	<p>
		I created this game for CPSC 599.82, Retrogames. It runs on the
		Commodore VIC-20 computer from 1980. This game is based on the
		Asphalt series of car racing games. The objective of the game
		is to maneuver your car to avoid obstacles for as long as
		possible. Once the car has crashed into obstacles three times,
		the game is over. There are four different difficulty levels of
		the game. Each level has a different colour scheme, setting,
		race course, and different obstacles. The race courses are
		stored in the computerâ€™s memory using layers of abstraction to 
		effectively reuse repetitive data and reduce memory 
		requirements. This game also uses self-rewriting code to 
		efficiently create the scrolling effect used in the game.

	<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Arkanoid</h2>
	<p>
		I developed this game for CPSC 359, Computing Machinery II. 
		It is a clone of the 1986 arcade game 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid">Arkanoid</a>. 
		In addition to the basic ball bouncing and brick breaking 
		mechanics, the game includes several extra features such as a 
		main menu system, the ability to pause and resume the game, a 
		game paused menu, a life counter, a score counter, and two 
		power-ups hidden behind bricks in the game. One power-up slows 
		down the ball making it easier for the player to precisely 
		bounce the ball, and the other power-up allows the player to 
		temporarily catch the ball and then launch it again rather than 
		simply bouncing the ball. In later versions of the game, I also added software 
		double buffering to prevent game elements from flickering when they are moving.
